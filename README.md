# SpotTheDifference #
By Joel Bernardes & Akash Surendran

## Overview of the project ##
This project is a simple spot-the-difference game in which the user has to spot the different sections compared to the others. The image is split up into a 3x3 grid with one section being a bit different from the others, to which the user must click on the section to move on to the next section (may have to click twice to select the window and then select the odd section). If the user would like to add their images, they can replace the pictures in the images folder with whatever they would like (they must be a .bmp, however, for the program to work).
